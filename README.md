# web3-twitter-accounts-analytics

This this the parser from the webiste https://ethleaderboard.xyz
It's a table with all twitters accounts that has ENS name.
The task for me was to parse all this data and convert ENS to the address.

Using the code, I generated the .csv file with 1k accounts.
This dataset can be used for many different purposes.
I don't care for now, but mabye in the future, do something cool with this data 🤘🏻
